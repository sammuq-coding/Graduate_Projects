Overview
This repository contains two advanced data analysis projects completed as part of my applied economics and data analytics coursework during my senior year at the University of Connecticut. Both projects emphasize data cleaning, statistical modeling, and visualization using R and Python, respectively.

Projects Included
1. Global Soccer Analysis (Global Soccer Analysis.Rmd)
Description
Analyzed soccer player performance data across multiple regions and leagues. The project investigates the relationship between player age and goals scored.

Key Tasks
Data import, cleaning, and preprocessing using R (dplyr, tidyr).

Regression modeling to explore the correlation between player age and goals.

Visualizations using ggplot2 to highlight trends and findings.

Skills Applied
R programming

Data Cleaning & Wrangling

Regression Analysis

Data Visualization

Outcome
Generated statistical insights into how player age affects scoring performance and compared patterns across different soccer leagues.

2. F1 Analysis (F1 Analysis.ipynb)
Description
Exploratory data analysis on Formula 1 race data, focusing on race outcomes, driver performance, and race conditions.

Key Tasks
Data cleaning using pandas and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Visualization of race outcomes, performance metrics, and historical trends using matplotlib.

Identifying key drivers, teams, and race factors affecting performance.

Skills Applied
Python programming

Data Cleaning & EDA

Data Visualization

Sports Analytics

Outcome
Delivered dashboards and visuals capturing race trends and driver performance insights, aiding in understanding key patterns within Formula 1 data.

How to Use
Open Global Soccer Analysis.Rmd in RStudio

Run each chunk sequentially to replicate analysis and visualizations.

Open F1 Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

Execute cells step by step to reproduce data analysis and plots.

Notes
Data sources are anonymized or simulated for educational use.

This repository showcases applied skills in sports analytics, econometric modeling, and data-driven storytelling.

Future work includes enhancing visual interactivity (using Tableau) and expanding modeling complexity.
